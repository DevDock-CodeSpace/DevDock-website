# Calsko (formerly DevDock)

A private software-engineering teaching workspace for one instructor and a few students. React + TypeScript + Vite,
React Router, Tailwind, shadcn/ui, TanStack Query; Supabase backend; hosted on Vercel at `www.calsko.com`.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:5173, against the DevDock Dev project (docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md)
npm run check   # lint, typecheck, build and performance budget; CI runs it on every PR
```

Node 22 LTS is recommended (supabase-js is pinned to a version that still runs on Node 20).
## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`. `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (Supabase → Project Settings → API)
are required; `VITE_GITHUB_APP_SLUG` (shows Connect GitHub) and `VITE_INACTIVITY_LIMIT_MINUTES` are optional.
Everything prefixed `VITE_` reaches the browser: **never** put a secret key, `service_role` key or DB password there.
Server secrets (JaaS, GitHub App, Gemini) are Edge Function secrets: `supabase secrets set NAME=value`.

## Database

- The schema lives in `supabase/migrations/` (append-only; never edit the dashboard). New one: `supabase migration new <name>`.
- Every table enables RLS in the migration that creates it; RLS is the security boundary, not the publishable key.
- After a migration: `supabase db push` (`--db-url` for Dev), then `npm run db:types` and commit the generated types.
- Pushes to `dev`/`prod` deploy migrations and Edge Functions automatically (`.github/workflows/deploy-supabase.yml`).

## Sign-in setup

- **Google Cloud → Google Auth Platform:** External app; scopes `openid`, `email`, `profile` (+ `calendar.events` for Calendar sync).
  Web client: JS origin = each site origin; redirect URI = `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`.
- **Microsoft Entra:** app for "any Entra tenant + personal accounts", redirect URI = the same Supabase callback, tenant URL `/common`.
- **GitHub (sign-in):** an **OAuth App** (Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps; not the DevDock GitHub App, which only
  connects repos). Homepage = the site; Authorization callback URL = the same Supabase callback. One OAuth App per Supabase
  project (Dev and live), because GitHub allows one callback URL per OAuth App.
- **Supabase → Authentication:** enable the providers with their client IDs and secrets (dashboard only). Site URL =
  `https://www.calsko.com`; Redirect URLs = each origin's `/auth/callback` (and Vercel previews). The app always uses
  `window.location.origin + '/auth/callback'`.

## GitHub App setup

1. GitHub → Developer settings → GitHub Apps → New. Callback URL `<origin>/github/callback`; tick "Request user authorization
   during installation"; webhook URL `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/github-webhook` with a secret; subscribe to
   **Pull request**; permissions Contents read/write, Pull requests read-only.
2. Note the App ID and Client ID, generate a client secret and a private key, convert the key:
   `openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -nocrypt -in key.pem -out key-pkcs8.pem`.
3. `supabase secrets set GITHUB_APP_ID=… GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=… GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=… GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=…` and
   `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat key-pkcs8.pem)"`; delete the `.pem` files. Set `VITE_GITHUB_APP_SLUG` in Vercel.

## Meetings and calendars
Add-to-calendar links and `.ics` downloads need no setup. Google Calendar sync needs the sensitive `calendar.events` scope:
publish the consent screen to stop weekly re-approval. Outlook sync was rejected (needs a verified Microsoft publisher).
